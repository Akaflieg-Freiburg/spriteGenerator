# spriteGenerator

This small command line utility generates sprite sheets for use in MapBox geographic maps, explained [here](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js-docs/style-spec/sprite/) and [here](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/sprite/). The utility is a replacement for [spritezero](https://github.com/mapbox/spritezero), which serve a similar purpose and is perhaps more advanced, but seems unmaintained.
